# Video-to-Audio-Converter
A very simple program that converts video files to audio files. We will use a python library known as MoviePy.

MoviePy is a Python library for video editing: cutting, concatenations, title insertions, video compositing (a.k.a. non-linear editing), video processing, and creation of custom effects. 

I have managed to convert a video file to an audio file using a single line of code. 

You can do loads of video editing using this library. Follow this link for further information.
